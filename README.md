# Snake Game üêç

This is a simple Snake Game built using Python and the `turtle` module. The game is an implementation of the classic Snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food, growing in size while avoiding collisions with itself.

## Features
- **Responsive Controls**: Use arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- **Infinite Boundaries**: The snake wraps around the edges of the screen.
- **Food Mechanic**: The snake grows in size when it eats food.
- **Reset on Collision**: The game resets if the snake collides with itself.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script.
2. Use the arrow keys to move the snake:
   - **Up Arrow**: Move up.
   - **Down Arrow**: Move down.
   - **Left Arrow**: Move left.
   - **Right Arrow**: Move right.
3. Try to eat the yellow square (food) to grow the snake.
4. Avoid colliding with the snake's own body; otherwise, the game resets.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `snake_game.py` file.
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
